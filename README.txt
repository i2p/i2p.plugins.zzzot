ZzzOT I2P Open Tracker Plugin
-----------------------------

This is a very simple in-memory open tracker, wrapped into an I2P plugin.
A compiled version of the plugin is available at http://stats.i2p/i2p/plugins/

The plugin starts a new http server tunnel, eepsite, and Jetty server running at
port 7662. The tracker status is available at http://127.0.0.1:7662/tracker/
If other files are desired on the eepsite, they can be added at eepsite/docroot

The open tracker code and jsps were written from scratch, but depend on some
code in i2psnark.jar from the I2P installation for bencoding, and of course on
other i2p libraries. See the license files in I2P for i2p and i2psnark licenses.
There is also some code modified from Jetty 5.1.15. See LICENSES.txt for the
zzzot and Jetty licenses.

I2P source must be installed and built in ../i2p.i2p to compile this package.

Sure, as a standalone program in its own JVM with Jetty, this would be a pig -
you should use the C opentracker instead. But since you're already running the
JVM and Jetty, running this in the same JVM probably doesn't hog to much more
memory.
